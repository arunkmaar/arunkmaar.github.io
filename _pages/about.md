<p style='text-align: justify;'> My research focuses on understanding the mechanics of thin structures-- how they deform, suddenly change their shapes, and interact with one another.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Our work typically involves observing certain phenomena and replicating them through desktop-scale lab experiments. Based on these experiments and observations, we develop mechanics-based models and implement them numerically to generate predictions. We then compare these predictions with experimental results to refine and validate our models.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Previously, I was a <a href='https://postdoc2.eurotech-universities.eu/projects/arun-kumar/'>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (Europostdoc2) postdoctoral fellow</a> in Prof. Basile Audoly's group at École Polytechnique, Paris. Recently, I had a short stint as a research engineer at INRIA, Grenoble. I received my Ph.D. from the Mechanics and Computation Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. </p>
