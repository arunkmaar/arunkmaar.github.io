<p style='text-align: justify;'> My research focuses on understanding the mechanics of thin structures--how they deform and interact with one another.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Our work typically involves observing certain phenomena and replicating them through desktop-scale lab experiments. Based on these experiments and observations, we develop mechanical models and implement them numerically to generate predictions. We then compare these predictions with experimental results to refine and validate our models.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Currently, I am a research engineer in the ELAN team at INRIA, Grenoble. Previously, I was a <a href='https://postdoc2.eurotech-universities.eu/projects/arun-kumar/'>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (Europostdoc2) postdoctoral fellow</a> in Prof. Basile Audoly's group at École Polytechnique, Paris. I received my Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> When free, I like to run, hike, dance and travel.</p>
