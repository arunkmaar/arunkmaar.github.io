title: Pinching a hemisphere with hole
description: This simulation was created using an in-house finite element implementation of a geometrically exact shell model. Cubic Lagrangian elements are used to circumvent the locking issues. We applied two vertical compressive and two horizontal tensile point loads at the larger edge of the hemisphere. Because of symmetry, only one quadrant is modeled, and the rest is reflected.
