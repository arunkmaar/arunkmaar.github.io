title: You and Your research. Advice to researchers by R W Hamming
date: 2023-08-24 00:00:00
description: The most important part of research is attacking an attackable research problem worth attacking. Most people know it, and yet most of us ignore it. I like the lecture "You and your research" by Prof. Hamming that talks about it.  You may find the complete lecture video on YouTube and a concise text version at the link above.
